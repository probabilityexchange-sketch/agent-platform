 * Skills Loader
 *
 * Implements the hybrid Option C skills system:
 *
 * - KNOWLEDGE skills: Markdown files read at runtime and injected into the
 *   agent's system prompt context window. The agent "knows" the skill.
 *
 * - ACTION skills: Registered as callable MCP/tool integrations in the chat
 *   route. The agent can actively invoke them (e.g., deploy a token, post a tweet).
 *
 * Skills are stored in /skills/<name>/SKILL.md relative to the project root.
 * Each AgentConfig can declare which skills it uses via its `tools` JSON config:
 *
 *   { "skills": ["clawnch", "react-expert", "supabase-expert"] }
 *
 * Action skills (those with MCP tool integrations) are listed in ACTION_SKILLS below.
 * All other skills are treated as knowledge skills and injected as system prompt context.
